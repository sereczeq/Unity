Unity Games I'm making whenever I have time

1. Labirynth Game - Game with Portal mechanics. The player has to find his way out of the Labirynt in set time. In his way he meets obstacles such as portals, doors for which he has to find keys and more.

2. Repeat Stuff - Android based, infinite scroller type game. Player has to manouver between platforms and obstacles, collecting coins.

3. Shooter Zombie - 3D clear room style game. Player has to clear all rooms from zombies, collecting health packs and ammunition. Abandoned project, too many bugs with 3D animations

4. UFO - Simple android game just to test few things.
